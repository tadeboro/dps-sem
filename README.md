# Watershed image segmentation algorithm

This project contains school project, so please do not expect perfect
code.

Main aim of this project is to play around with Octave's internals and
try to implement reasonably efficient watershed algorithm. If something
approximatelly usable comes out of this project, well, let just say that
I would be pleasantly surprised;)
